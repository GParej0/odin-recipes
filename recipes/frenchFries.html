    <h3>Ingredients (Serves 2)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large Russet potatoes</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil (for frying)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into sticks (about 1/4 inch thick).</li>
        <li>Place the potato sticks in a bowl of cold water for at least 30 minutes to remove starch (this makes them crispy!).</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes and pat them completely dry with paper towels. (Water causes hot oil to splatter, be careful!).</li>
        <li>Heat about 2 inches of oil in a deep pan or pot to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Carefully add the potatoes in batches. Do not overcrowd the pan.</li>
        <li>Fry for about 5-6 minutes until they are soft and pale (not brown yet). Remove and drain on a rack.</li>
        <li>Increase the oil heat slightly. Return the potatoes to the oil and fry for another 2-3 minutes until golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain on paper towels and sprinkle with salt immediately while hot.</li>
    </ol>
