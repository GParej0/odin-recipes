    <h3>Ingredients (Serves 2)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp milk or water (optional, makes it fluffier)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp butter or oil</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded cheese (cheddar or mozzarella) - optional</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs (parsley or chives) for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add milk (if using), salt, and pepper. Whisk until well blended.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat until melted.</li>
        <li>Pour the egg mixture into the pan. Let it cook for a minute without stirring until the edges start to set.</li>
        <li>Gently push the cooked edges toward the center with a spatula, allowing the uncooked egg to flow to the edges.</li>
        <li>When the eggs are mostly set but still slightly soft in the middle, sprinkle the cheese over one half.</li>
        <li>Fold the omelette in half over the cheese. Cook for another minute until the cheese melts.</li>
        <li>Slide onto a plate and garnish with herbs. Serve immediately.</li>
